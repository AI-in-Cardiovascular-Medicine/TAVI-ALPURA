# TAVI-ALPURA
```

TAVI-ALPURA is an AI-based tool for predicting long-term all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Developed on a Swiss cohort and externally validated in a Japanese cohort, it outperformed conventional risk scores for long-term outcome prediction and demonstrated strong generalizability across diverse populations.

TAVI-ALPURA combines "ALP" (Swiss Alps) and "URA" (from Sakura, Japan's cherry blossom), reflecting its Swiss and Japanese origins!
